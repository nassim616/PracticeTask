//        Tasks for if statement : 13)caught speeding.
//        You are driving a little too fast, and a police officer stops you.
//                Write code to compute the result, encoded as an int value:
//        0=no ticket, 1=small ticket, 2=big ticket. If speed is 60 or less, the result is 0.
//        If speed is between 61 and 80 inclusive, the result is 1. If speed is 81 or more, the result is 2.
//        Unless it is your birthday -- on that day,
//                your speed can be 5 higher in all cases.



//        First you have to create variable for the speed (int) and for the isBirthday (boolean).
//        1:17 PM
//        Second you have to create if statement - if isBirthday  is false and then check if the speed in the range (<60, >60 and <=80, >81)
//        1:18 PM
//        if is Birthday is false you should check if the speed in the range (all the same but +5 - <65, >65 and <85, >86
//        1:18 PM
//        2) middle three - you did it using hard coding - but you should use integer and calculate
//        first the length of the string - and then find the middle. and use middle inside substring method


//
//        int speed =
//
//        boolean birthday = false;
//
